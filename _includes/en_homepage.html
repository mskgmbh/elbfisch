                        Elbfisch offers a runtime environment and a canon of basic functions that enable the team-based
                        development of object-orientated automation applications when used in conjunction with common
                        open-source products (such as the integrated development environments ‘Netbeans’ and ‘Eclipse’),
                        Linux as operating system and ‘git’ as distributed version management system. Java is used for
                        the programming.

                    <p>
                        The Elbfisch concept is based on the principle that an automation application needs to represent
                        a copy of the process that it controls. A process (a system) is made up of aggregates that
                        interact with each other and may themselves be made up of subordinate aggregates. Elbfisch
                        modules can be used to represent this hierarchy of aggregates. Modules can be implemented
                        independently, have defined interfaces with no side-effects and, when implemented universally,
                        can be re-used in any implementations.

                    <h3 class="glyphe glyphe-signal"><span class="hightlight">Signals</span></h3>
                    <p>
                        Like the aggregates that have to interact in a system that is being automated, the
                        representative Elbfisch modules must also exchange information with one another. To make this
                        possible, Elbfisch uses the concept of signals. A module receives information from other modules
                        via signals and uses signals to send information to other modules.

                    <h3 class="glyphe glyphe-gears"><span class="hightlight">Process events</span></h3>
                    <p>
                        One of Elbfisch’s main features is the modules’ ability to react to process events and process
                        them. The range of possible process events is unlimited. For example, possible events include:
                        the end of a set time period, a signal change at an input terminal, an analogue value being
                        exceeded, combined events, an event not taking place within a set time frame, emergency stop
                        situations, a system being shut down. Modules can explicitly wait for events to occur, at which
                        point they are activated by Elbfisch.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="glyphe glyphe-stopwatch"><span class="hightlight">Synchronous design</span></h3>
                    <p>
                        Elbfisch uses a time-slicing process (a cycle) to control an application’s modules, occurring
                        events and the exchange of signals. For example, a module will wait until the next cycle to
                        forward a signal change to all consuming modules. This allows all input signals for all modules
                        to remain unchanged and consistent in any given cycle. This in turn ensures that the module
                        workflow allows freedom for interaction. The modules can run in any order within a cycle, and
                        even interrupt each other. The signals that are exchanged remain consistent in all cases.

            <p>
                Embedded PC systems are increasingly being implemented in automation technology, encouraging the design
                of object-orientated software development processes, a step which is long overdue. To assist with this,
                Elbfisch offers a runtime environment and a canon of basic functions that allow complex automation tasks
                to be implemented on inexpensive hardware platforms in Java.

                We are now handing over our project to the open-source community. We are doing this with gratitude to
                the many people and businesses who have been sharing their knowledge and products with others for years.
                We have been using open-source products ourselves for many years. The time has now come for us to make a
                large part of our knowledge available to the community. We hope that others find this useful – and that
                it contributes to peace in the world. The latter much less through the content, but more through the way
                in which people work together on this project – with mutual respect, with the necessary regard for the
                perspectives of others and with recognition of every person’s wish to use their work to make the world a
                better place – each providing according to their ability, with the dedication they are individually
                prepared to invest, regardless of their background or religion. Elbfisch has emerged from our
                professional work on a variety of projects and covers a range of functions that we consider useful for
                our particular purposes. We hope that Elbfisch will now grow beyond this scope, enriched by new
                perspectives, with added functions that will broaden its range of applications.
